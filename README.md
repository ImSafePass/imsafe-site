# ImSafe Pass Website

This repo contains all the code/content for the frontend website for ImSafe Pass (imsafepass.com).

## Quick start

1. **Start developing.**

   ```shell
   yarn install
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Deploying**

   Push to the `master` branch to auto-deploy to Netlify. Push to the `dev` branch to autodeploy a dev build.

## What's inside

This site is a relatively vanilla Gatsby app. Read up on Gatsby to get a better sense of how it works.

Pages are in `src/pages`, and reusable components are in `src/components`.

Because the site is relatively simple, with one main breakpoint, the styles are HTML-driven, as opposed to largely component- and page-specific.
