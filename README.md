# ImSafe Pass Website

This repo contains all the code/content for the frontend website for ImSafe Pass (imsafepass.com).

## Quick start

1. **Start developing.**

   ```shell
   yarn install
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Deploying**

   The site deploys to Netlify.

   [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4e134c4c-a5a3-4220-9858-c83436225bf9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/imsafe-site/deploys)

   Push to the `master` branch to auto-deploy to Netlify. All pull requests automatically deploy a demo branch. It's a best practice to PR and preview code live before merging it into master/production.

## What's inside

This site is a relatively vanilla Gatsby app. Read up on Gatsby to get a better sense of how it works.

Pages are in `src/pages`, and reusable components are in `src/components`.

Because the site is relatively simple, with one main breakpoint, the styles are HTML-driven, as opposed to largely component- and page-specific.

Tooling is configured in the `gatsby-config.js` file in project root.
