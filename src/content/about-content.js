    `We know there is a way to get back to normal in the wake of Covid-19 without compromising on public health, personal privacy or our civil liberties. Our goal is to put actionable data in the hands of individuals, and to empower them to decide with whom to share it — their health providers, schools, customers, employers, and loved ones.`,
    `We believe that some kind of verified immunological record or passport is an essential next step for public health and economic revival. We also believe such a solution does not need to put our privacy at risk.`,
    `Early on in the roll-out of shelter-in-place mandates and business shutdowns, we were taken aback by the rapid suspension of basic rights across many countries. Many have signaled a desire to extend government into the management and scoring of personal biological data. Some governments have already launched intrusive, mandatory programs to track citizens’ location, monitor their financial transactions, and delimit their movement in society.`,
    `We are deeply concerned by these trends, and believe a superior and privacy-protecting alternative can resolve the urgency motivating countries to sideline civil liberties in order to reopen. This is what we're racing to build: a platform that keeps data in individuals' hands, critically analyses and qualifies test results, and allows for easy sharing with user consent.`,
