        "As laboratory and at-home tests become more broadly available, both antibody and active infection tests will provide critical information, but not the whole picture. It takes more than a single test to determine an individual’s immunity to Covid-19, or for that matter, that they are virus-free. Even in ideal circumstances, the margin of error is too great for any one to be safely deemed decisive. We combine and analyze multiple tests and broader community data points to arrive at a single, high-confidence score that is easy to understand and communicate.",
